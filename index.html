                Player of the Match: It was really cold. I enjoyed playing on this ground. Playing after a long time and batting at number four, there was some pressure one me. I had one thing in my mind that I have to play my game. First 2-3 balls, I feel a bit of pressure, after that I just focus on the ball and I don't think much on what's going on. In T20s, I know what I bat, and I know I can hit big sixes, so I can generate runs any time. Bowling, today I got the opportunity and I executed what I needed.

                Rinku Singh - I have got a habit of batting at 6 and finishing games. Enjoyed the cold conditions, it was tough while fielding though. I just try to talk to myself, batting at 6, I don't have the chance to face too many balls or score too many runs, that's the thing I keep telling myself. I've spoken with Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni), he just told me to react according to the ball, keep your calm and I just do the same thing. I don't think a lot while batting, just react to the ball.
